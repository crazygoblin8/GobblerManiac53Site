<h1>Jail sentence</h1>
<p> At 19, while attempting to steal a car in broad daylight, GobblerManiac was caught by the police and sent to jail. At first he couldn't believe what was happening, it all felt so surreal. This had never happened before, his crimes were free of all flaws!
But this was reality, he was in jail. He behaved good in jail, doing everything he was told to do. This continued for most of his sentence but towards the end he started to feel even more depressed. He couldn't supress his feelings any more, he wanted to be
free, he wanted out. He started crying himself to sleep everyday, that helpt a bit, but he was still feeling down. At one point the pain was to much to handle so he unscrew one of the screws on his bed and with all the power he could muster, stabbed his
left arm. He pulled it out and stabbed again, and again, until he couldn't anymore. He fell unconcious because of the blood-loss. When he woke up again he was in some sort of hospital.He looked at his arm and saw a bandage around his wound. He startet to
cry. When he got back from the hospital he was threwn right back into his cell like nothing happened. A month after the incident he got released. He had now served his time.
