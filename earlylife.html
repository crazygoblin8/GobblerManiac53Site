<h1>Early life</h1>
<p>Born 1992 on March 20th in Ohio, USA, GobblerManiac's childhood was tough as he was raised by his single father who was not only very poor, but also an alcoholic. Because of his financial situation he often found himself doing illegal business to earn money for 
food. This includes, but is not limited to pickpocketing, grand theft auto, and selling drugs. Because of his consitent crimes he often found himself in trouble with the law, but GoblerManiac was smart, and there were never any evidence of that it was actually 
him. One day when he got home from selling drugs he found his father sitting in his regular chair, but something felt off. He went to take a closer look and before him was a horrible scene. His father was unconsious, foam in his mouth, small holes on his left 
arm, and multiple syringes lying on the floor. His father had commited suicide. He started crying, screaming, breaking things. The only person who had ever cared about him was dead. After this incident his crimes started to become even more sloppy and eventually,
at 19, GobblerManiac got arrested.
