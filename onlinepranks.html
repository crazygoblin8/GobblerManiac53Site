<h1>Online pranks</h1>

Enrolling into university, GobblerManiac felt truly happy for the first time in his life. He enjoyed his time at university and met a lot of friends. His life was finally looking like it would go somewhere. When studying he found himself using a digital
encyclopeida tool called "Wikipedia". He found this tool to be extremly helpful for his studies. After some time he realized that the reason there was so much information on Wikipedia was because anyone could edit the pages on there. That got him thinking:
"What if I edited a page?". He opened his laptop and clicked in on a random page. The page he clicked on was a page for a fish species called Aethaloperca Rooga. He clicked on the edit button and wrote "This fish also has the nickname Gobbler." He chuckled to
himself for a bit then closed the page and though nothing of it. Some time after the incident he was using his computer to chat with his friends on Facebook. All of a sudden he got a message from a stranger called Maniac53 saying: "I know where you live, I can 
see you, now do as I say." He wrote back: "Who is this?" As a response he got: "Your demise." He got scared and asked his roommate if he knew who this Maniac53 was. He shook his head and GobblerManiac went back to his desk. The stranger sent back a message
saying: "If I see you write anything more on Wikipedia, I will have you get expelled from the University of Florida." GobblerManiac felt afraid and remembered that when editing a page if he did not create an account his IP address would be public. Since he didn't 
know what an IP address was he just ignored it. He then asked his roommate "What's and IP address?" "Internet Protocol address or IP addressm as it's more popularly know as, is a numerical label that is connected to a computer network that uses the Internet 
Protocol for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: network interface identification and location addressing." "Uh oh." GobblerManiac says. "What?" "N-nothing." GobblerManiac was scared. How could he be so naive?! He writes back to Maniac53
saying: "I'm so sorry, that will never happen again!" He then closes Facebook and goes onto Wikipedia again. He pressed the create account button and it tells him to choose a nickname. He think for a while and then combines all of his memories about editing on
Wikipedia togheter and puts in "GobblerManiac53" He presses sign up and goes on a spree of writing on Wikipedia pages and talk pages. After editing he always signs it with "-GobblerManiac53". He found this hobby to be hilarious, but after a while when he tried
to enter Wikipedia he noticed his account had gotten suspended and asked his roommate how that could happen. His roommate responded with "The only reasons for getting suspended is if you screw around on a page or if you get falsely reported. They really have to
fix their system with false reports, it ruins it for people genuinely trying to add or fix information on pages." "Umm, actually I screwed around on pages..." "Wow, I did not think you would do something like that. What is wrong with you? Do you think this is
some kind of joke? That is extremly stupid and immature. That is just annoying for everyone else. Not only for the people reading, but also for us editors who have to revert your idiocy. I genuinely wish for the worst for you." GobblerManiac started to feel bad
about what he had done. Was his roommate right? Did he go to far. He was upset so he went onto a site he had been frequently visiting called Twitter. When he went on he saw that the hastag GobblerManiac53 was trending. "Wow! I'm famous!." he though. He went in
and saw that people were writing great stuff about him and that many tried to follow in his footsteps. He felt happy about all the attention, so he told his roommate. "Ugh, now even more people are going to ruin pages. I better get on and try to fix all the shit
that's going to be put out."
