<h1>Depression</h1>
<p> After being released at 22 he lived with one of his friends while trying to find a job. Though with his criminal record this would become a great challenge. With every rejected job he got his depression grew more and more. After a year of searching for jobs
his depression had grown to the point where he could no longer feel any emotions. No matter how much he tried. He tried everything to feel anything, some things he tried include alcohol, drugs, self-harm by cutting, sex, partying, but nothing seemed to make
him happier. At last he had had enough, mid-party he went to the hardware store and bought a rope. He went back and went into his room. He noticed two people in there having sex, but they didn't seem to notice him. He took a chair, stood up and tied the rope
to the roof and then a noose. He put his head inside of the noose and kicked back the chair. He started to feel euphoric hanging there. He felt the air leave his lungs and everything started to become black. All of a sudden he woke up. Infront of him he saw
a naked man doing cpr on him. It was the same man that was having sex before. He stuck his head up and the man o n top of him sighed in relief. "Dude, you got have died there. Be careful, man." he says. He felt that it was hard for him to breath, but he was
alive. He then went out and pored himself a cup of booze and started to drink it. After 4 more years of living a life of alcohol, drugs, and sex he felt something. Something dfifferent. He felt that he wanted to change his ways. He felt he was not living the life
he wanted to live. He decided that he needed a major change in his life. Though he didn't know how. He went into his room and lay down on his bed. He started pondering, how could he fix this. He continued to ponder for days until he had it. He went out, phone in
hand and yelled: "Everyone! Get the fuck out of here or I'll call the cops." Everyone started to run towards the door, scared of getting arrested. Everyone except for his friend. "Dude, what hell, man? Why'd you do that? I was just about to bang Christine!"
"It's time for a change. We can't keep on living this way." "Ugh, whatever, man. Fine." He started to clean up his apartment. It took a long time, but after a month his apartment was clean. After that he went onto his old laptop and started applying for university.
After some time he got a letter in the mail. He opened it expecting yet another rejection, Â´but that was not the case. He had been accepted into accounting at the University of Florida. He was ecstatic.
